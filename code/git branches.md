Create a copy of your code seperate from the main codebase to test, fix, and add to your code.

## merging

Merge changes made in branches back into the main branch. In vscode you do this by 

1. switching to main
2. hover branch
3. click merge branch
4. select the branch you want to merge into main

Then you can delete the old brach (or keep it/rename it)

## deleting

after deleting a brach locally, you can remove it from your remote by calling

> 
> `git push origin :branch1`
>
