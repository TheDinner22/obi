After construction of the AST, but before compilation completes, the compiler will expand all syntax extensions.

This involves traversing the entire AST, locating syntax extensions, and then replacing them with their expansions.

Syntax extensions can be expanded into any of the following

-   an expression,
-   a pattern,
-   a type,
-   zero or more items, or
-   zero or more statements.

In short, [[1.2 Macros in the AST#you can|where you invoke a syntax extension]] affects what it will be expanded into!

## how expansion happens

Expansion happens in passes which means the compiler can expand code recursively. This means you can call macros inside of other macros! 

By default, the #recursion limit is 128. This can be manually overridden with the `#![recursion_limit="â€¦"]` attribute.
